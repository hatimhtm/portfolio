## 📄 Pages

### `/` — Home
The hero section features **mouse-aware parallax gradient blobs**, a rotating marquee ticker, an animated stats strip (projects shipped, years of experience, response time), and a **3D Bento Grid** showcasing featured work with depth and glow effects. Includes an about/bio section with headshot, a philosophy & process breakdown, service previews (Velocity Launch & AI Augmentation), and a bold CTA.

### `/work` — Work
Displays all projects as interactive cards with staggered entrance animations, category tags, tech badges, and metrics. Each card links to a **dynamic case study page** (`/work/[slug]`) built with `generateStaticParams`, featuring problem/solution/outcomes narratives and live GitHub links.

### `/stack` — Stack
A skills dashboard organized into **Frontend**, **Backend**, **AI/ML**, and **DevOps** categories. Each tool has a proficiency bar and a one-liner description. Includes a "Currently Learning" section (Rust, Kubernetes, Three.js, Solidity).

### `/services` — Services
Two service packages — **Velocity Launch** (production MVPs in 12 hours) and **AI Augmentation** (LLM integration, RAG pipelines, custom agents). Features a side-by-side **Agency vs. Me** comparison table with detailed feature breakdowns.

### `/contact` — Contact
A **multi-step contact form** (name → email → budget → brief) powered by Formspree, with an animated FAQ accordion, social links, and contact info (location, response time, languages spoken: English, French, Arabic, Mandarin).

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- **No UI libraries** — every component (`BentoGrid`, `CommandPalette`, `MagneticButton`, etc.) is built from scratch for full creative control
- **Neo-Brutalist meets Luxury** — high-contrast acid palette (`#CDFF00`, `#FF006E`, `#3A86FF`) combined with glassmorphism, film grain overlays, and premium typography
- **Motion as a first-class citizen** — staggered reveals, spring physics, 3D tilt, parallax, and page transitions via Framer Motion
- **Performance-first** — React Server Components where possible, `next/font` for zero layout shift, optimized SVG patterns
